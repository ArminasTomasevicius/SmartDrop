Users can boost their airdrop rewards by donating additional tokens or engaging with the community, ensuring that those who contribute to the ecosystem benefit the most.

## 🌟 Why SmartDrop?

Airdrops today are plagued by inefficiencies—bad actors exploit them, farming tokens without adding value to the project.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **🔒 Stake Tokens, Earn Rewards**  
   Users stake existing ERC20 or LP tokens to participate. Staked tokens are locked during the farming period, and participants earn airdrop credits based on their staking terms.

2. **📈 Boost Your Airdrop**  
   Users can donate tokens to gain a Boost, maximizing their airdrop credits.

3. **⏳ Flexible Farming Options**  
   Choose between shorter lockups or staking until the airdrop token launches, with higher rewards for longer commitments.

4. **🎁 Claim Rewards, Retrieve Stake**  
   After the airdrop token launches, users reclaim their original stake alongside their earned airdrop credits.
